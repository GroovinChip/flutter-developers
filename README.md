## How to add yourself

1. Create your assets folder in `assets/developers/your_name`, then add your avatar image.
2. Add your assets folder to `pubspec.yaml`
3. Create a page in `lib/developers/your_name` called `YourNamePage`
4. Add a card to `lib/main.dart` that includes your name, business, avatar, and your page
5. Optional: Take a `580x1031` screenshot and add it to `docs/` and `README.md`

## Notes

1. I will almost certainly accept your PR if your content is G rated and stays within your page.
2. You are solely responsible for your developer folder and assets folder.
3. I encourage you to use your page as a showcase / elevator pitch.
4. If a PR is stuck feel free to tag me here or on Discord.
